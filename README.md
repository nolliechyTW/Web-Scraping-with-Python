# Web-Scraping-with-Python
Use the BeautifulSoup, requests, xiwings and other packages to conduct web crawling with Python

ChickPT is a mobile application for part-time student workers in Taiwan. 
The app includes a points system, social games, job safety, job-seeker credits, and other extended services. 
An online real-time task was added during the pandemic, providing remote services, such as playtime or study with children during lockdowns. 

I analyze the HTML grammar ofChickPT for the content I want to crawl, including the name of the part-time job, the name of the employer, the salary, the update time, and the url link and write the Python program to capture information and save it in the excel file.

User only need to press the execute button to quickly grasp the latest 20 pieces of part-time job information.
This program helps me quickly browse all vacancies and increase my chances of getting part-time jobs during the pandemic.
